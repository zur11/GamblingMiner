# BTC Mining Pools & Hardware Shop — Implementation Plan

**Status**: Phase 1 ✅  Phase 2 ✅  Phase 3 ✅  Phase 4 ✅  Phase 5 ✅  Phase 6 ✅ (wiring; Task 6.2 smoke test = manual, in-editor) — **roadmap Step 6 is now active and RE-SCOPED**

> **Phase 3 implementation note (model decision):** the linear model was chosen over the plan's
> literal per-credit loop. **1 bet = 1 nonce attempt** (canonical rule preserved); speed is locked to
> total credits and each bet's single attempt is **round-robin routed** across the node's credit slots
> (first `IndividualPoolCredits` → own chain, rest → casino). Over `TotalCredits` bets this yields
> exactly `IndividualPoolCredits` own + `CasinoPoolCredits` casino attempts — a true reallocation of
> power, not a multiplier (avoids the quadratic `TotalCredits²` attempts/sec of the literal loop).
> Routing lives in `HardwareAllocationRepository.NextNonceTarget(nodeId)`; betting moved to
> `SimulationService` (player + bots) with the manual path in `DiceGame.ProcessBlockchainAttemptForBet`.
> **Rate is read LIVE from hardware** (`SimulationService.HardwareRate(nodeId)` in `_Process`/`TickBots`/
> `GetActiveMiningRates`) — never cached at autobet start — so buying/moving credits mid-run takes effect
> immediately (bet rate, Block Explorer ⛏ readout, and difficulty feed-forward all update at once). The
> DiceGame ApsSelector is display-only and re-locked to hardware via `RefreshHardwareDrivenSpeed()`
> (also from `ApplyAutoBetSpeedSettings`, so a strategy load can't reset the shown value to a stale 1X). (see "Step 6 Scope & Decisions" below). This plan builds on the **per-node candidate block model** (`candidate-block-model-plan.md`, roadmap Step 4) — per-credit nonce routing mines real candidates.
> ⚠️ **Two corrections to this plan since it was written:**
> 1. **Gradual miner spawning is POSTPONED** (needs a per-bot strategy set first), so for now we keep **DEV access to all bettable nodes**; the "player + 4 bots at block 1" assumption is fine for the prototype.
> 2. **The bot/player betting loop moved to `SimulationService`** during the background-simulation work — so Phase 3's nonce-routing/speed-lock now targets `SimulationService.ExecutePlayerBetOnce` / `ExecuteBotBet`, **not** `DiceGame.ExecuteBotBet` / `BotAutoBetRunner` (those no longer exist in DiceGame).

**Architecture summary**:
- **Option 2 (solo / P2P)**: each hardware credit in a node's *individual pool* generates 1 nonce attempt per bet, routed to that node's own blockchain — current behavior, extended with hardware count control.
- **Option 1 (community pool)**: hardware credits assigned to the *casino pool* route each bet's nonce attempt to the casino node's blockchain; the casino distributes block rewards to contributors proportionally minus a dynamic fee.
- **Option 3 (hybrid coordinator)**: designed in a future plan — reserved for post-Basic Mode.

**Starting state**: player + 4 bots each receive **2 hardware credits** at bootstrap (1 individual, 1 casino pool).  
Betting speed in DiceGame is **locked to total hardware credits** (not freely selectable). 2 credits → 2 bets/second.

## Step 6 Scope & Decisions (2026-06-23)

Answers that re-scope Step 6 (`IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` Step 6 = gradual participants + miner bots + hardware pools):

- **Bots never mine without the player** (original decision stands — time only advances while the player participates). **Gradual miner-bot spawning is POSTPONED** until a curated set of per-bot strategies exists; each miner will *later* spawn gradually with its era-appropriate hashrate. **For now: keep DEV access to all bettable nodes** in DiceGame (no intro gating).
- **FIRST — Network Difficulty Regulator** (dedicated section below): foundational; **built first**, independent of gradual spawn and hardware.
- **Bot Play-History scene** — moved to its **own plan** (`bot-play-history-plan.md`); sequenced **after** the regulator, tracked separately.
- **Hardware credits at introduction:** deferred until a hardware **prototype** is working — build the prototype first (flat credits), wire credit-at-introduction afterward.
- **Era-based hashrate + obsolescence:** deferred to the definitive Basic-Mode build.
- **DEV features** (free "Buy Hardware", dev access to all nodes, dev panels): fine **while developing**; **all DEV features are removed for the final Basic Mode.**

### Revised Step 6 order
1. **Network Difficulty Regulator** (foundational — this plan, section below).
2. **Bot Play-History scene + Notepad access** — own plan (`bot-play-history-plan.md`).
3. **Hardware/pools prototype** — credit model + casino pool + hardware-locked speed (routed through `SimulationService`); credit-at-introduction & obsolescence deferred.
4. **Gradual miner spawning** — postponed to a later step (once per-bot strategies exist).

---

## NEW SYSTEM — Network Difficulty Regulator

**Goal**: replace the static difficulty with a regulator that keeps the **average block time near a target** as total network power and participant count change. Foundational for hardware/pools (more power must be pushed back) and gradual spawning (more participants must be pushed back). Buildable **now** against the current model.

### Current state
- **Before D.1:** difficulty was **static & discrete** — `"00"` prefix + next-hex ≤ '6' (≈585 expected attempts/block; the "~107" figure in old docs was wrong).
- **After D.1 (done):** difficulty is a **continuous, persisted-per-block** value (`Block.Difficulty`), seeded at `InitialDifficulty = 4096/7 ≈ 585.14` (same pace). The regulator (D.2) just needs to make `GetNextBlockDifficulty()` dynamic.

### Design principles (grounded in real BTC)
- **Block time is the canonical signal.** Real Bitcoin **never measures hashrate** — it only compares actual vs. expected **block time** and retargets. Block time already captures *total* network power **and** participant count **and** variance. (So measuring power directly is redundant as the *primary* control.)
- **Use TOTAL hashrate, not average.** If/when we add a power term, it must be the **sum** of all active miners' power (Σ credits × bets/sec). The *average* normalizes out participant count — the very variable we want included. `total = avg × count`.
- **Bitcoin classic** retargets every **2016 blocks**: `newDifficulty = oldDifficulty × (expectedTimespan / actualTimespan)`, clamped to **[0.25×, 4×]**. Robust but slow; oscillates on small/spiky networks.
- **Per-block algorithms (DigiShield / LWMA)** retarget **every block** from a weighted moving average of recent solvetimes (recent weighted more). Fast, smooth, oscillation-resistant — **the better fit for this fast, fractal game.**

### Finalized implementation (decisions baked in)

**Constants** (`BlockchainService`): `TargetBlockSeconds = 58_500` (OQ-8), `LwmaWindow = 20` (OQ-10), `MaxStepUp = 2.0`, `MaxStepDown = 0.5` (OQ-10), `MinDifficulty = 1.0` floor, `DifficultyEaseAlpha = 0.7` (smoothing, tuned by test).

> **Final shape = HYBRID + easing** (OQ-11 reversed, 2026-06-23): `target = anchor × feedbackTrim`, then ease: `next = current + DifficultyEaseAlpha × (target − current)`.
> - **anchor** (feed-forward): `InitialDifficulty × networkPower` — the correct difficulty for the current *known* total power (= `(TargetBlockSeconds/clockSpeed) × power`). Instant, unclamped. `0` power (bootstrap/idle) → hold at current (feedback-only).
> - **feedbackTrim** (LWMA over `W` solvetimes, clamped `[0.5×, 2×]`): the real-process block-time correction for calibration drift + variance.
> - **easing** `α=0.7`: ramps a change in over ~3 blocks instead of snapping (user-tuned).

- **0. Continuous difficulty (foundational refactor).** Replace the discrete prefix rule with a numeric `Difficulty = expectedAttemptsPerBlock` (double). Acceptance: interpret the 64-hex block hash as a 256-bit `BigInteger` `H`, accept if `H ≤ 2²⁵⁶ / Difficulty` (probability `1/Difficulty`). `IsHashAtTargetDifficulty(hash, difficulty)` takes the difficulty; `GetExpectedAttemptsForCurrentDifficulty()` returns the **current chain** difficulty. Seed the genesis/initial difficulty at **≈585** (today's effective value) so nothing changes until the regulator runs.
- **1. Persisted per block (OQ-12).** Add **`Block.Difficulty`** (the value the block was mined against). Mining a candidate: difficulty is computed from the previous blocks (below), written onto the block, and the PoW must satisfy it. Validation (`ChainIsValid`) checks each block's hash against **its own** `Difficulty`. On load, the **current** difficulty = the last block's `Difficulty` → O(1), no genesis replay.
- **2. Primary regulator — LWMA block-time feedback (OQ-9).** When building the next candidate, compute the next difficulty from the last `W` blocks' solvetimes (in-game timestamp deltas), recent blocks weighted more (linear weights), then `nextDifficulty = clamp( currentDifficulty × (TargetBlockSeconds / lwmaSolvetime), currentDifficulty×0.5, currentDifficulty×2.0 )`, and not below `MinDifficulty`. (Fewer than `W` blocks early on → use what's available / hold at seed.)
- **3. Anti-oscillation / safety.** Per-step clamp + `MinDifficulty` floor. Timestamps are engine-controlled (no adversary) → we **skip** Bitcoin's median-time-past / timestamp-attack defenses.
- **4. Fractal calibration.** `TargetBlockSeconds` is fixed (OQ-8); `W`/clamps/`α` tunable. Calibrate so **relative** jumps mirror BTC's fractal (~16.5× across 2010), not absolute hashes.
- **Feed-forward — REINSTATED as a hybrid (OQ-11 reversed).** Pure block-time feedback was too slow to converge in a tiny network; the user chose to bring back the power term as the instant *anchor*, with the LWMA as the trim. Total power (Σ active miners' bets/sec) is pushed from `SimulationService` (`GetActiveMiningRates` sum) into `NetworkRoot.SetActiveMiningPower`, read by `GetNextBlockDifficulty(power)`.
- **Where it lives.** `BlockchainService.GetNextBlockDifficulty(double networkPower)`, called from the mining path (`NodeAgent` → `NetworkRoot`). No separate per-frame service.

### Difficulty Regulator — small steps
- **D.1 — Continuous difficulty + persisted target (no behavior change yet).** ✅ **DONE.** `Block.Difficulty` field (persisted via the existing JSON chunks/snapshot); `BigInteger` target math (`MaxHash256`, `HexToBigInteger`); `IsHashAtTargetDifficulty(hash, difficulty)`; `InitialDifficulty = 4096/7 ≈ 585.14` (the *exact* probability of the old `"00"`+next-hex-≤'6' rule → identical pace) seeded on genesis + every new block; `ProofOfWork`/`CommitBlock` take + stamp the difficulty; `GetNextBlockDifficulty()` (D.1: returns the tip's difficulty = constant) and instance `GetExpectedAttemptsForCurrentDifficulty()` read the tip; `ChainIsValid`/`TryAcceptMinedBlock` validate each block against **its own** `Difficulty`; `EffectiveDifficulty` coerces a missing/0 value (pre-D.1 save) to `InitialDifficulty`. **Verified:** chain mines + validates + round-trips across reload. *Files:* `Models.cs`, `BlockchainService.cs`, `NodeAgent.cs`, `NetworkRoot.cs`.
  - **Display added early (a slice of D.3, for verification):** Block Explorer now shows the network difficulty on the chain-info line, the latest-block panel, and the per-block lookup. The richer **avg block time + trend** still belongs to D.3.
- **D.2 — Retarget (HYBRID, not pure LWMA).** ✅ **DONE + user-tested.** `GetNextBlockDifficulty(networkPower)` = `anchor × feedbackTrim`, eased by `α`. Feed-forward anchor = `InitialDifficulty × power`; LWMA feedback trim (clamped); easing `α=0.7`. Power plumbed `SimulationService.SetActiveMiningPower` → `NetworkRoot._activeMiningPower` → `NodeAgent` → `GetNextBlockDifficulty`. `Block.MiningPower` stamped (diagnostic).
  - **Bootstrap pin (fix):** the regulator is **bypassed during `_bulkMining`** — bootstrap blocks are mined at a fixed `InitialDifficulty` (`MineForNode` passes `forcedDifficulty`). The historical pre-mine uses *scripted* timestamps, so running the block-time feedback there is meaningless and was drifting the start difficulty (e.g. down to ~100). Now the game starts at ~585 and the regulator takes over only for live play.
  - **First-attempt / per-tip lock (fix):** difficulty is locked on the **first nonce attempt at a tip** (`NodeAgent._candidateDifficulty` keyed by `_difficultyTipHash`) and kept for the whole block **across mempool changes** (a bot tx rebuilds the template but must not move the difficulty — this was the "current block changes" bug). A power/participant change *before* the first attempt counts for that block; *after*, it applies from the next. `GetPlayerNextBlockDifficulty` reports the locked value.
  - **Manual/auto parity (fix):** manual betting now sets the same network power (player + configured bots) via `DiceGame.SetManualMiningPower` before the bet, so manual mining regulates difficulty identically to autobet (previously manual left power at 0 → stuck at player-only difficulty).
  - *Verified: a bot joining ramps difficulty up over a few blocks and block time settles back near target; removing it ramps down; bootstrap starts at ~585.*
- **D.3 — Block Explorer readout.** ✅ **DONE.** Main chain-info line shows the **mining (next-block) difficulty** (`GetPlayerNextBlockDifficulty`) + trend (vs last block) + **recent avg block time** vs target; each block's own difficulty stays in its panel/lookup. Auto-refresh via the 1 s tick.
- **D.4 — Calibrate & document.** ✅ **DONE.** Tuned `α=0.7` (kept `W=20`, clamp `[0.5×,2×]`) by test; documented in `ProjectDesignManual.md` Ch.26 + `CLAUDE.md`. (Fractal-scale calibration of `TargetBlockSeconds`/jumps remains a future tuning item when later eras land.)

## Bot Play-History scene — moved out

The Bot Play-History scene (last 260 plays per active miner bot + Notepad access) now has its **own plan**: **`AIHelperFiles/bot-play-history-plan.md`**. It's part of Step 6 but tracked separately and **sequenced after the Difficulty Regulator**. (Decisions OQ-13/OQ-14 live in that file.)

---

## Current State

### What already exists

**`Scripts/BlockchainPort/Simulation/NetworkRoot.cs`**
- `TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(nodeId, out Block? minedBlock, long? minedAtUnixMs)` — the nonce-attempt call; accepts any registered node ID.
- `HandleMinedBlock(miner, block, minedAtUnixMs)` — fires when any node mines a block; triggers reward coinbase, broadcasts.
- `GetBlockRewardForNextCandidate(miner)` — current halving-aware reward calculation.
- `CasinoNodeId = "casino"` — casino already exists as a registered `NodeAgent` with full keys.
- `SharedNodesById` — dictionary of all registered nodes (player, bot_1..4, non-miners, casino).

**`Scripts/BlockchainPort/Simulation/NodeAgent.cs`**
- `TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(rewardAmount)` — single-nonce method; independent of DiceGame bet count.
- `CreateCoinbaseReward(amount)` — creates the coinbase TX for reward distribution.

**`Screens/DiceGame/DiceGame.cs`**
- `NodeStrategyState.BetsPerSecond` — per-node integer that currently drives the `ApsSelector` (1–99, free selection).
- `BotAutoBetRunner` — per-bot accumulator that fires `ExecuteBotBet` at the configured rate.
- `GetRunnerEffectiveBetsPerSecond(runner)` — currently returns `runner.Strategy.BetsPerSecond`.
- `GetAutoBetBaseAps()` — reads `_apsSelector.Selected + 1`.
- All node-nonce calls happen in: `_blockchainNetworkRoot.TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(nodeId, ...)` inside the player's `_Process` loop and inside `ExecuteBotBet`.

**`Screens/MainMenu/`**, **`Scripts/Services/SceneManager.cs`** — navigation infrastructure ready for new scene entry.

### What does not yet exist

- Hardware credit concept — no model, no persistence, no service.
- Casino community pool — no pool membership, no reward queue, no payout pipeline.
- BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop scene.
- Hardware-driven speed lock in DiceGame (ApsSelector still free).

## New Concepts

### Two-Piece Hardware Model + Obsolescence (decided 2026-06-21)

> Design decisions captured while on the `scheduled-bot-transactions` branch (referral OQ-C surfaced them). They belong to **this** future hardware/pools branch — route to `main` so they persist.

**Every miner has two kinds of hardware:**

1. **Base (Piece 1) — the computer.** A normal laptop/PC. Always present (one per node), gives the baseline hashrate, and is **not** the thing you keep buying. Era-appropriate baseline: 2009 ≈ a Core 2 Duo laptop (~1–5 MH/s) or an i7 desktop (~20–30 MH/s).
2. **Accelerator (Piece 2) — the timeline-appropriate, buyable piece.** The hardware/software that makes sense in the current in-game era and complements the base. **These are what the player buys to raise mining power** (they map onto the "hardware credits" below — each accelerator ≈ credits / nonce-attempts per bet). The accelerator **changes by era** (see timeline) and **becomes obsolete** over time.

**A minimal viable miner = Base (1) + at least one Accelerator (1).** Buying more / better accelerators increases hashrate.

**Obsolescence (default for Basic Mode):** an accelerator's *competitive* life averaged ~**12 in-game months** in the 2009–2012 window (CPU → GPU → FPGA → ASIC waves each obsoleted the prior tier). Default obsolescence = **12 in-game months**, and it should **shorten in later eras** (ASIC era → a few months). The hardware/pools scene shows each piece's **remaining lifetime live**. (Competitive/economic life is shorter than physical life — model the economic one.)

**Era timeline (historical reference — from `hardware mineria.txt`):**

| In-game era | Accelerator (Piece 2) | Approx hashrate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2009 early | CPU baseline (Core 2 Duo laptop) | ~1–5 MH/s | difficulty = 1; CPU sufficient |
| 2009 late | Multi-core CPU (i7) + code optimizations (midstate, SIMD) | ~20–30 MH/s | 2–8× over single-core; ~10–20% from optimizations |
| 2010-07 | **GPU** (NVIDIA GTX 260 ~200–300 MH/s; AMD Radeon 5970 ~600–700 MH/s) | ~200–700 MH/s | ArtForz; 50–100× CPU; the big jump |
| 2010-07 | Mining **pools** (Slushpool) | — | distributes risk, not raw speed (maps to our casino pool) |
| 2011 | Multiple GPUs | ~1–2 GH/s | competition heats up |
| 2012 | FPGA (research → early units); ASIC research begins | ~ tens of GH/s | GPUs still viable |
| 2013-01 | **ASIC** (Avalon, Antminer…) | ≫ GPUs | GPUs become useless; ASIC industry era |

Difficulty grew ~16.5× across 2010 (≈1 → ~12,000 by Dec 2010); our fractal must scale the *relative* jumps, not the absolute numbers.

**How it connects:** Piece 2 (accelerators) are the buyable units modeled by the **hardware credits** below; the Base is the starting credit a node always has. Obsolescence retires accelerator credits over time, pushing the player to keep upgrading.

### Hardware Credit

A **hardware credit** is an abstract unit representing one dedicated mining pipeline.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| 1 credit → | 1 nonce attempt per bet executed by its owning node |
| Pool assignment | Either **individual** (node's own chain) or **casino** (casino community pool) |
| Stacking | Owning node bets `total credits` times per second (all pools combined) |
| Default on purchase | Assigned to individual pool until manually moved |

Each node's total betting speed in DiceGame = `IndividualPoolCredits + CasinoPoolCredits`.

### Individual Mining Pool (Option 2 — unchanged behavior)

Each credit assigned here makes the node's `TryMineSingleNonceAttempt` fire once per bet — same as the current system. If the node mines a block it keeps 100% of the reward. No change to existing nonce or reward logic needed.

### Casino Community Pool (Option 1 — new)

| Concept | Detail |
|---|---|
| Who runs it | The casino `NodeAgent` (already registered) |
| Mining power source | Sum of all casino-pool credits from all contributors |
| Nonce call | `TryMineSingleNonceAttempt("casino", ...)` — one call per contributed credit, per bet cycle |
| Block reward | Casino node's coinbase reward goes to a **pending reward queue** instead of the casino wallet directly |
| Fee calculation | Dynamic; based on casino pool power vs. total individual pool power (see below) |
| Payout | Distributed proportionally to contributors after fee deduction; each payout is a real `CreateAndBroadcastTransactionToAddress` call from casino wallet |
| Transaction fee | 0.1 BTC deducted from each payout (lowest fee available to casino) |

#### Casino Fee Formula

```
casinoTotalCredits   = sum of CasinoPoolCredits across all participating nodes
individualTotalCredits = sum of IndividualPoolCredits across all non-casino nodes

ratio = casinoTotalCredits / max(1, individualTotalCredits)

if ratio == 1.0  →  fee = 30%   (balanced)
if ratio > 1.0   →  fee = lerp(30%, 50%, clamp01((ratio - 1.0) / 2.0))
if ratio < 1.0   →  fee = lerp(10%, 30%, ratio)
```

Starting state: each of 5 nodes contributes 1 credit → casino total = 5, individual total = 5 → ratio = 1.0 → **fee = 30%** ✓

## Architecture

### New Data Models

**`Scripts/Hardware/HardwareModels.cs`** (new file)

```csharp
namespace Scripts.Hardware;

public record NodeHardwareState
{
    public string NodeId { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public int IndividualPoolCredits { get; init; } = 0;
    public int CasinoPoolCredits { get; init; } = 0;
    public int TotalCredits => IndividualPoolCredits + CasinoPoolCredits;
}

public record HardwareAllocationSnapshot
{
    public List<NodeHardwareState> Nodes { get; init; } = new();
}

public record CasinoPoolPendingPayout
{
    public string RecipientNodeId { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string RecipientAddress { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public decimal GrossAmount { get; init; }     // before tx fee
    public decimal NetAmount { get; init; }        // after 0.1 BTC tx fee
    public int FromBlockIndex { get; init; }
}

public record CasinoPoolRewardEvent
{
    public int BlockIndex { get; init; }
    public decimal TotalReward { get; init; }
    public decimal CasinoFeePercent { get; init; }
    public decimal CasinoFeeAmount { get; init; }
    public List<CasinoPoolPendingPayout> Payouts { get; init; } = new();
    public bool Distributed { get; init; } = false;
}

public record CasinoPoolState
{
    public List<CasinoPoolRewardEvent> RewardHistory { get; init; } = new();
}
```

### New Repository: `HardwareAllocationRepository`

**`Scripts/Hardware/HardwareAllocationRepository.cs`** (new file)  
Persists to `user://hardware_allocation.json`.

```csharp
// Key methods:
NodeHardwareState GetNode(string nodeId);
void SetNode(NodeHardwareState state);
void MoveCreditsToIndividual(string nodeId, int count);
void MoveCreditsToCasinoPool(string nodeId, int count);
void AddCredits(string nodeId, int count);   // new hardware purchased; goes to individual
int TotalCasinoPoolCredits();               // sum across all nodes
int TotalIndividualCredits();               // sum across all nodes
```

### Integration into `NetworkRoot`

`NetworkRoot` already owns the casino `NodeAgent` and `HandleMinedBlock`. Casino pool logic is added here:

```csharp
// New members in NetworkRoot:
private static CasinoPoolState _casinoPoolState = new();
private const string CasinoPoolStatePath = "user://casino_pool_state.json";
private const decimal CasinoTxFee = 0.1m;

// New public methods:
public void TryCasinoNonceAttempt(out Block? minedBlock, long? minedAtUnixMs = null);
public void DistributeCasinoReward(int blockIndex, decimal totalReward, 
                                    Dictionary<string, int> contributorCredits);
public static decimal CalculateCasinoFeePercent(int casinoTotal, int individualTotal);
public List<CasinoPoolRewardEvent> GetCasinoPoolHistory();
```

---

## Phase 1 — Hardware Credit Data Model & Persistence

**Files to create**: `Scripts/Hardware/HardwareModels.cs`, `Scripts/Hardware/HardwareAllocationRepository.cs`

### Task 1.1 — HardwareModels.cs

Create the records defined in the Architecture section above.  
Namespace: `Scripts.Hardware`.  
No Godot dependencies — pure C# data.

### Task 1.2 — HardwareAllocationRepository

**File**: `Scripts/Hardware/HardwareAllocationRepository.cs`

Persistence path: `user://hardware_allocation.json` (CamelCase JSON, `FileAccess`).

```csharp
public static class HardwareAllocationRepository
{
    private const string SavePath = "user://hardware_allocation.json";
    private static HardwareAllocationSnapshot _snapshot = new();

    public static void EnsureLoaded();
    public static NodeHardwareState GetNode(string nodeId);
    public static void SetNode(NodeHardwareState updated);
    public static void AddCredits(string nodeId, int count);      // to individual pool
    public static void MoveToIndividual(string nodeId, int count); // from casino pool
    public static void MoveToCasinoPool(string nodeId, int count); // from individual pool
    public static int TotalCasinoPoolCredits();
    public static int TotalIndividualCredits();
    public static IReadOnlyList<NodeHardwareState> AllNodes();
    private static void Save();
}
```

**Guard**: `MoveToIndividual` / `MoveToCasinoPool` must not reduce either pool below 0.

### Task 1.3 — Bootstrap Initial Allocation

**Where**: `WalletInitializationService.EnsureAll()` — after `BotWalletRegistry.EnsureAll()`.

If `user://hardware_allocation.json` does not exist, bootstrap:

```csharp
// 5 nodes: "player", "bot_1", "bot_2", "bot_3", "bot_4"
// Each gets: 1 individual credit, 1 casino pool credit
foreach (string nodeId in new[] { "player", "bot_1", "bot_2", "bot_3", "bot_4" })
{
    HardwareAllocationRepository.SetNode(new NodeHardwareState
    {
        NodeId = nodeId,
        IndividualPoolCredits = 1,
        CasinoPoolCredits = 1
    });
}
```

Starting totals: casino pool = 5 credits, individual = 5 credits → ratio = 1.0 → fee = 30%.

---

## Phase 2 — Casino Mining Pool Service (NetworkRoot Integration)

**Files to modify**: `Scripts/BlockchainPort/Simulation/NetworkRoot.cs`  
**Files to create**: `Scripts/Hardware/CasinoPoolRepository.cs`

### Task 2.1 — CasinoPoolRepository

**File**: `Scripts/Hardware/CasinoPoolRepository.cs`  
Persists `CasinoPoolState` to `user://casino_pool_state.json`.

```csharp
public static class CasinoPoolRepository
{
    public static void EnsureLoaded();
    public static CasinoPoolState Current { get; }
    public static void AddRewardEvent(CasinoPoolRewardEvent evt);
    public static void MarkDistributed(int blockIndex);
    public static List<CasinoPoolRewardEvent> GetUndistributed();
    private static void Save();
}
```

### Task 2.2 — Casino Fee Calculator in NetworkRoot

```csharp
public static decimal CalculateCasinoFeePercent(int casinoTotal, int individualTotal)
{
    if (individualTotal <= 0) return 0.50m;
    double ratio = (double)casinoTotal / individualTotal;
    if (ratio >= 1.0)
    {
        double t = Math.Clamp((ratio - 1.0) / 2.0, 0.0, 1.0);
        return (decimal)(0.30 + t * 0.20); // 30% → 50%
    }
    else
    {
        return (decimal)(0.10 + ratio * 0.20); // 10% → 30%
    }
}
```

### Task 2.3 — TryCasinoNonceAttempt in NetworkRoot

```csharp
public void TryCasinoNonceAttempt(out Block? minedBlock, long? minedAtUnixMs = null)
{
    EnsureInitialized();
    minedBlock = null;
    if (!SharedNodesById.TryGetValue(CasinoNodeId, out NodeAgent? casino))
        return;

    decimal reward = GetBlockRewardForNextCandidate(casino);
    minedBlock = casino.TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(reward);
    if (minedBlock is null)
        return;

    HandleMinedBlock(casino, minedBlock, minedAtUnixMs);
    // Intercept: do NOT send coinbase to casino wallet directly — queue for distribution.
    QueueCasinoRewardForDistribution(minedBlock, reward);
}
```

### Task 2.4 — Reward Distribution Pipeline

After a casino block is mined, `QueueCasinoRewardForDistribution` is called:

```csharp
private static void QueueCasinoRewardForDistribution(Block block, decimal reward)
{
    // Snapshot current contributor credits at the time of mining.
    var allNodes = HardwareAllocationRepository.AllNodes();
    int casinoTotal  = HardwareAllocationRepository.TotalCasinoPoolCredits();
    int indivTotal   = HardwareAllocationRepository.TotalIndividualCredits();

    decimal feePercent = CalculateCasinoFeePercent(casinoTotal, indivTotal);
    decimal feeAmount  = Money.Normalize(reward * feePercent);
    decimal poolAmount = reward - feeAmount;

    var payouts = new List<CasinoPoolPendingPayout>();
    foreach (NodeHardwareState n in allNodes.Where(n => n.CasinoPoolCredits > 0))
    {
        decimal share = Money.Normalize(poolAmount * n.CasinoPoolCredits / casinoTotal);
        decimal net   = share - CasinoTxFee;
        if (net <= 0m) continue;

        string address = GetNodeAddress(n.NodeId); // lookup from NodeAgent or registry
        payouts.Add(new CasinoPoolPendingPayout
        {
            RecipientNodeId = n.NodeId,
            RecipientAddress = address,
            GrossAmount = share,
            NetAmount = net,
            FromBlockIndex = block.Index
        });
    }

    var rewardEvent = new CasinoPoolRewardEvent
    {
        BlockIndex    = block.Index,
        TotalReward   = reward,
        CasinoFeePercent = feePercent,
        CasinoFeeAmount  = feeAmount,
        Payouts = payouts,
        Distributed = false
    };

    CasinoPoolRepository.AddRewardEvent(rewardEvent);
    // Attempt distribution immediately (casino wallet might have enough confirming balance).
    TryDistributePendingCasinoRewards();
}
```

`TryDistributePendingCasinoRewards` iterates `CasinoPoolRepository.GetUndistributed()`, calls `CreateAndBroadcastTransactionToAddress("casino", payout.RecipientAddress, payout.NetAmount)` for each payout, marks event as distributed once all succeed. Distribution can fail if the casino block reward is not yet confirmed (needs to wait for block N+1). Retry on next block.

### Task 2.5 — Hook Distribution Retry into HandleMinedBlock

```csharp
// At the end of HandleMinedBlock (after existing logic):
TryDistributePendingCasinoRewards();
```

This ensures that after every new block (by any node), the casino checks if pending rewards are now spendable and distributes them.

## Phase 3 — DiceGame Hardware-Locked Speed & Nonce Routing

**File to modify**: `Screens/DiceGame/DiceGame.cs`

### Task 3.1 — Lock ApsSelector to Hardware Total

Replace `InitializeApsSelector()` behavior for hardware-driven nodes:

```csharp
private void RefreshHardwareDrivenSpeed()
{
    HardwareAllocationRepository.EnsureLoaded();
    NodeHardwareState hw = HardwareAllocationRepository.GetNode(_activeNodeId);
    int total = Math.Max(1, hw.TotalCredits);

    // Lock ApsSelector to hardware total; hide or disable it.
    if (_apsSelector != null)
    {
        _apsSelector.Select(Math.Clamp(total, 1, MaxAutoBetBaseAps) - 1);
        _apsSelector.Disabled = true;
    }
}
```

Call `RefreshHardwareDrivenSpeed()` from:
- `_Ready()` after `InitializeApsSelector()`
- `OnActiveNodeSelected()`
- Any time hardware credits change (event from `HardwareAllocationRepository`)

`NodeStrategyState.BetsPerSecond` is still set from hardware total via `RefreshHardwareDrivenSpeed` — all existing downstream code continues to work unchanged.

### Task 3.2 — Per-Bet Nonce Routing (Player Loop)

In the player's `_Process` autobet execution, each bet currently calls:
```csharp
_blockchainNetworkRoot.TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(PlayerNodeId, out Block? minedBlock, ...);
```

Replace with a routing loop that mirrors hardware allocation:

```csharp
private void ExecutePlayerNonceAttempts(DateTime utcTimestamp)
{
    NodeHardwareState hw = HardwareAllocationRepository.GetNode(PlayerNodeId);

    // Individual pool: N nonce attempts for player's own chain.
    for (int i = 0; i < hw.IndividualPoolCredits; i++)
    {
        if (_blockchainNetworkRoot.TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(PlayerNodeId, out Block? b, ...))
            HandlePlayerMinedBlock(b!);
    }

    // Casino pool: M nonce attempts for casino chain.
    for (int i = 0; i < hw.CasinoPoolCredits; i++)
    {
        _blockchainNetworkRoot.TryCasinoNonceAttempt(out Block? _, ...);
        // Casino reward is handled internally by NetworkRoot — no player action needed.
    }
}
```

This replaces the existing single `TryMineSingleNonceAttempt` call. The total call count = `hw.TotalCredits`, matching the hardware-locked APS.

### Task 3.3 — Per-Bet Nonce Routing (Bot Runner Loop)

In `ExecuteBotBet(BotAutoBetRunner runner)`, apply the same routing:

```csharp
NodeHardwareState hw = HardwareAllocationRepository.GetNode(runner.NodeId);

for (int i = 0; i < hw.IndividualPoolCredits; i++)
{
    if (_blockchainNetworkRoot.TryMineSingleNonceAttempt(runner.NodeId, out Block? b, ...))
        OnBotMinedBlock(runner.NodeId, b!);
}

for (int i = 0; i < hw.CasinoPoolCredits; i++)
{
    _blockchainNetworkRoot.TryCasinoNonceAttempt(out Block? _, ...);
}
```

`GetRunnerEffectiveBetsPerSecond(runner)` returns hardware total instead of `runner.Strategy.BetsPerSecond`:
```csharp
private double GetRunnerEffectiveBetsPerSecond(BotAutoBetRunner runner)
{
    NodeHardwareState hw = HardwareAllocationRepository.GetNode(runner.NodeId);
    return Math.Clamp(hw.TotalCredits, 1, MaxAutoBetBaseAps);
}
```

## Phase 4 — BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop Scene (Unified)

One scene for now; shop can be split into its own scene later once behavior is stable.

**Files to create**:
- `Screens/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop.tscn`
- `Screens/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop.cs`

### Task 4.1 — Scene Structure

```
BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop (Control)
├── StatusBarPlaceholder (HBoxContainer) — StatusBar injected here
├── BackBtn (Button) → MainMenu
└── MainSplit (HSplitContainer)
    ├── NodeListPanel (VBoxContainer) — left column ~260px
    │   ├── Title: "Mining Nodes"
    │   ├── NodeList (VBoxContainer) — one button per node
    │   │   ├── NodeBtn_player
    │   │   ├── NodeBtn_bot_1  ... NodeBtn_bot_4
    │   │   └── NodeBtn_casino

            └── CasinoPoolStatsPanel (VBoxContainer) — shown only when casino is selected
                ├── TotalContributedLabel
                ├── CurrentFeeLabel
                ├── ParticipantsLabel
                └── RewardHistoryList (VBoxContainer)
```

### Task 4.2 — Controller Logic

**Node list**: build one `Button` per node (player, bot_1..4, casino). Clicking a button calls `SelectNode(nodeId)` which populates the detail panel.

**Detail panel for non-casino nodes**:
- Show `NodeId` title + `TotalCredits` summary
- Individual pool row: credits label + `[→ Casino Pool]` button (moves 1 credit; disabled if IndividualPoolCredits == 0)
- Casino pool row: credits label + `[← Individual]` button (moves 1 credit; disabled if CasinoPoolCredits == 0)
- After any move: call `HardwareAllocationRepository.MoveToIndividual/MoveToCasinoPool`, refresh UI, emit event to DiceGame

**Detail panel for casino**:
- Show pool statistics:
  - "Total casino pool credits: N"
  - "Current fee: X.X%"
  - "Individual total credits: M" (for fee context)
  - Participant list with credits per node
  - Last 10 reward events (block index, total reward, fee amount, net distributed, status)

**Buy Hardware button** (DEV only, shown for selected non-casino node):
- Calls `HardwareAllocationRepository.AddCredits(selectedNodeId, 1)` (to individual pool)
- Refreshes detail panel
- Refreshes DiceGame speed if selectedNodeId is player (via event or service call)

**Hardware change event**:
```csharp
// Static event — DiceGame subscribes in _Ready()
public static event Action<string>? HardwareChanged; // string = affected nodeId
```
`HardwareAllocationRepository` raises this after every credit modification. DiceGame calls `RefreshHardwareDrivenSpeed()` when the active node is affected.

### Task 4.3 — StatusBar Integration

```csharp
public override void _Ready()
{
    GetNode<HBoxContainer>("%StatusBarPlaceholder").AddChild(new StatusBar());
    // ... rest of setup
}
```

---

## Phase 5 — SceneManager Registration & Navigation

**File to modify**: `Scripts/Services/SceneManager.cs`

### Task 5.1 — Add Scene Entry

```csharp
public enum SceneId
{
    // ... existing entries ...
    BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop,  // new
}

private static readonly Dictionary<SceneId, string> Paths = new()
{
    // ... existing paths ...
    [SceneId.BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop] = "res://Screens/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop/BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop.tscn",
};
```

### Task 5.2 — MainMenu Navigation Button

**Files to modify**: `Screens/MainMenu/MainMenu.tscn`, `Screens/MainMenu/MainMenu.cs`

Add `BTCPoolsAndHardwareShopBtn` button wired to:
```csharp
_sceneManager?.Go(SceneManager.SceneId.BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop);
```

Label text: `"Mining Pools & Hardware"` (or `"Pools & Shop"` if space is tight).

---

## Phase 6 — Bootstrap Wiring & Smoke Test

### Task 6.1 — EnsureLoaded on Startup

`HardwareAllocationRepository.EnsureLoaded()` must be called before any DiceGame session starts.  
Best hook: `WalletInitializationService.EnsureAll()`, after `BotWalletRegistry.EnsureAll()`.

```csharp
// In WalletInitializationService.EnsureAll():
HardwareAllocationRepository.EnsureLoaded();    // new line
CasinoPoolRepository.EnsureLoaded();            // new line
```

### Task 6.2 — Smoke Test Checklist

Before marking all phases done:

- [ ] Fresh game: 5 nodes each show `IndividualPoolCredits = 1`, `CasinoPoolCredits = 1`
- [ ] DiceGame player autobet rate locked to 2/s; ApsSelector is disabled showing "2X"
- [ ] Bot runners each run at 2 bets/second
- [ ] After a casino block mined: `CasinoPoolRepository` shows a reward event; 5 payout records created
- [ ] After the next block (any miner): casino sends BTC to each contributor; BlockExplorer shows transactions from casino wallet to each node address
- [ ] Casino fee at 30% with starting 1:1 ratio
- [ ] BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop: buy +1 hardware for player → player now shows 3 credits (2 individual, 1 casino); DiceGame speed becomes 3/s
- [ ] Move 1 credit to casino pool → player: 1 individual, 2 casino; speed still 3/s; casino pool total = 6
- [ ] Fee recalculates correctly with the new ratio. NOTE: after that move the player keeps **1**
      individual credit, so individual total = 5 (4 bots + player), casino total = 6 → ratio 1.2 →
      **32%** by the exact Task 2.2 formula (`0.30 + clamp((ratio−1)/2,0,1)×0.20`). The earlier
      "~40%" was loose prose; the implemented formula is the source of truth.

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Should the casino fee formula use *total* individual credits or *average per node*? Current design uses total vs total. | Fee at starting state = 30% (balanced) either way if symmetric; diverges as players buy different amounts of hardware. Total vs total is simpler. |
| OQ-2 | What happens if a contributor's casino-pool payout net amount ≤ 0 (reward too small to cover 0.1 BTC fee)? | Current plan: skip that payout silently. Could accumulate across events. TBD. |
| OQ-3 | Should `BuyHardwareBtn` have a cost, or remain free for the entire Basic Mode? | User specified free for now (testing). Pricing TBD with hardware variety later. |
| OQ-4 | Should casino pool credits generate any SC income for the contributor, or only BTC mining rewards? | Not specified. Current design: only BTC. SC betting results are unaffected by pool assignment. |
| OQ-5 | Should the player be able to set 0 individual credits (all credits in casino pool)? | Mechanically valid. Means all player bets contribute to casino chain only. Needs UI warning since player won't mine their own blocks at all. |
| OQ-6 | Should moving credits between pools be instant or require a "next block" delay (simulating hardware migration latency)? | Instant for Basic Mode. Real-world delay could be a future detail. |
| OQ-7 | Should `CasinoPoolStatsPanel` show each bot's contributed credits to the player, or only the player's own share? | Currently both are shown. May be too much information. TBD UX pass. |

### Resolved decisions (2026-06-23)

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| OQ-8 | **`T_target` = 58,500 in-game seconds/block** (≈16h40m at 100X). Fixed — it's what keeps temporal + fractal coherence with the 100X scale. |
| OQ-9 | **LWMA per-block** retarget (recommended). Document it thoroughly once implemented. |
| OQ-10 | **`W` = 20 blocks**, **per-step clamp [0.5×, 2×]** (recommended). Explain clearly in the docs. **Also: show the live network difficulty in the Block Explorer** (only there, for now). |
| OQ-11 | **REVERSED → hybrid feed-forward.** Pure block-time feedback converged too slowly in a tiny (1–5 miner) network. The power term is back as the instant *anchor* (`InitialDifficulty × power`), with the LWMA as the trim, and an easing factor `α` so changes ramp over a few blocks rather than snapping. |
| OQ-12 | **Persisted** difficulty (store the target per block) — not recomputed from genesis (could get slow at large heights). Periodic weekly/monthly/yearly reference snapshots are a *maybe-later* if the chain grows huge. |

*(OQ-13 / OQ-14 concerned the Bot Play-History scene — moved to `bot-play-history-plan.md`.)*

## Future: Option 3 — Hybrid Coordinator (Post-Basic Mode)

This is a design sketch only. No implementation is planned until after Basic Mode is complete.

### Concept

In the hybrid model, the player (and potentially the casino) can act as a **coordinator** that runs multiple sub-pools simultaneously. Each sub-pool behaves like the casino community pool, but the player is the one collecting fees and distributing rewards.

```
Player Coordinator
├── Sub-pool Alpha  ← bot_1, bot_2 contribute credits
│     Stratum server analogue: player's node collects their nonce attempts
└── Sub-pool Beta   ← bot_3, bot_4, non-miner bots contribute
      Different fee schedule, different hardware capacity
```

### Game Design Implications

| Mechanic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Player becomes "pool operator" | Sets their own fee percentage (within game-defined limits) |
| Competing pools | Player pool vs casino pool; bots evaluate fee competitiveness |
| Pool reputation | Bots prefer pools with consistent payouts and fair fees |
| Multiple casino pools | Casino could run geographically distinct pools (game narrative: different mining farms) |
| Entry unlock condition | Suggested: player mines first block independently in Basic Mode |
| Revenue stream | Pool fees become a parallel SC/BTC income stream alongside casino operations |

### Open Design Questions for Option 3

- Should bots dynamically reallocate hardware between pools based on fee competitiveness?
- Can the player poach contributors from the casino pool with lower fees?
- Is there a maximum number of sub-pools a coordinator can manage?
- How is this surfaced in the UI? A second screen (PoolCoordinator) or an extension of BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop?
- Does the block template builder (P4 roadmap) interact with pool selection?

## Difficulty Regulator — Power-Step Contingency Plan (2026-06-25)

**Status**: F0 ✅ + dev time-accel tool ✅ + Test Run #1 + power-accounting audit + **F5 steady-state run** done (2026-06-25). **VERDICT: regulator correctly calibrated** (steady-state power 2: realized 2.05 ≈ 2.0, ratio 0.94, difficulty ≈ anchor) → the ~1.4× was transient feed-forward+feedback overshoot, **not** a bug. No anchor/accounting fix needed. Remaining = optional polish (F1 EMA / F2 asymmetric easing) for the transient on large steps; F3 dropped, F4 fallback. One open item: confirm once at power ≈10. Extends the hybrid regulator (OQ-11/OQ-12).

### Context — what triggered this

A ~80-in-game-day test run (121 blocks; chain at `user://blockchain/state.json`) with **all bots + the casino pool active** and an **extra hardware credit bought for the player and assigned to the casino pool**. Goal was to watch the difficulty regulator across a power step and compare per-share payouts of that extra credit in the casino pool.

### Empirical findings

**Baseline (blocks 2–117, power ≈ 1, difficulty pinned at `InitialDifficulty` 585.14):** the regulator is excellent. Feedback-only mode (power 0/1) held difficulty flat and solvetimes hugged target — mean ratio **0.98×**, **sd 0.16**, range 0.70–1.28×, **0%** of blocks slower than 2×. Note the **low sd (0.16)**: this sim's per-block solvetime is *tightly regulated*, not a noisy exponential PoW process.

**Transition (block 118): power stepped ~1 → 11** (bots + casino pool switched on). The feed-forward anchor correctly identified the new equilibrium (`InitialDifficulty × 11 ≈ 6437`) and easing ramped difficulty 585 → 4658 → 5357 → 5396 → 5611 over 4 blocks. But solvetime ratios came out **2.43×, 1.64×, 0.49×, 0.78×**.

Because baseline sd is 0.16, the 2.43× block is a **~9σ event — structural, not variance.** Inverting `realizedPower = 100 · difficulty / solvetimeSec` (calibration verified by baseline ≈ 1.0) gives the realized throughput during the transition:

| Block | Difficulty | Solvetime ratio | Realized power |
|---|---|---|---|
| 118 | 4658 | 2.43× | **~3.3** (stall) |
| 120 | 5396 | 0.49× | **~18.9** (catch-up burst) |
| 121 | 5611 | 0.78× | **~12.3** (settling) |

So during block 118 the network only delivered attempts equivalent to power ~3.3, although **the power reported to the regulator was a clean step to 11** (`HardwareRate` is a constant config value, summed over running sessions — there is *no ramp in the regulator's input*).

### Root cause — two stacked effects at a power step

1. **Deterministic easing ramp (~3 blocks, by design).** `next = current + α·(target − current)` with `DifficultyEaseAlpha = 0.7` ramps difficulty up over a few blocks. During the ramp difficulty sits *below* equilibrium, so this makes early blocks *faster*, not slower — it is **not** the cause of the slow block 118.

2. **Throughput transient (the real culprit for block 118).** `StartBots()` builds all `BotRunner`s in one synchronous loop (they all tick on the same frames), each with `AccumulatorSeconds = 0` (so no synchronized burst at t=0, but execution is concentrated). At the moment of enabling the fleet (buy hardware + assign to pool + pool/UI spin-up) a **frame hitch** produces a large `delta`; `Math.Min(accum + delta, MaxBacklogSeconds = 2.0)` **discards** attempts beyond 2 real-seconds' worth → permanent loss → throughput dips (~3.3). The retained 2 s backlog then flushes → overshoot (~18.9) → settles (~12.3). Bot cold-starts (base bet, fresh bankroll, early stop→recharge→restart cycles) cost extra ticks in that first interval.

> The anchor is fed the *instantaneous configured* power (11) while the *realized* throughput during the first block is ~3.3 → difficulty is briefly priced for more power than is present → the slow block. Lowering `α` only softens effect (1); it does **not** address effect (2), which is what produced block 118.

Code paths: power feed `SimulationService.GetTotalActiveMiningPower()` → `NetworkRoot.SetActiveMiningPower()` (stores static `_activeMiningPower`) → `BlockchainService.GetNextBlockDifficulty(_activeMiningPower)`. Execution caps in `SimulationService` (`MaxBetsPerFrame = 10`, `MaxBacklogSeconds = 2.0`, per-node accumulators in `_Process` / `TickBots`).

### Goal

After a **power step** (enable fleet / add hardware), the first 1–3 blocks should not be mis-priced, **without** distorting the long-run pace or the response to power *drops*. Recommended order by leverage: **F0 → F1 → F3 → F2 → (F4 fallback) → F5.**

### Phase F0 — Instrumentation & baseline *(prerequisite, no logic change)* ✅

Stop inferring realized power; measure it.

- **What**: on each mined block, append a row `utcMs, miner, index, configuredPower, realizedPower (= difficulty·clockSpeed/solveSec), difficulty, anchor, solveSec, solveRatio` → `user://logs/difficulty_trace.csv`. (`feedbackTrim`/`easedNext` deferred — not needed to confirm the issue; can be added for F5 tuning.)
- **Where**: ✅ `NetworkRoot.AppendDifficultyTrace()`, called from `HandleMinedBlock` **inside the `!_bulkMining` guard** — so the historical bootstrap replay is excluded and only **live-mined** blocks are traced. Per-chain (uses the miner's own `Chain[^2]` for solvetime); rows interleave across chains → filter by the `miner` column. `clockSpeed = TargetBlockSeconds / InitialDifficulty`. Build verified green.
- **Acceptance**: reproduce a power step and capture the realized-power curve; confirm or refute the stall→burst→settle pattern before changing logic. ✅ **done — see Test Run #1 below.**
- **Risk**: none (read/log only).

### F0 Test Run #1 (2026-06-25) — findings & plan revision

First live trace (`difficulty_trace.csv`, 17 blocks, indices 113–129, single shared chain). A **power step 2 → 10** at block 117 (anchor jumped 1170 → 5851 = `585 × {2,10}` ✓). Clock confirmed: `CalendarTimeService.SpeedMultiplier = 100`, calendar free-runs on `delta × 100` (not per-bet), so `realizedPower = difficulty × 100 / solveSec` measures the **true attempt-execution rate** with no clock artifact. **This run overturns part of the earlier (state.json-based) diagnosis.**

**Finding 1 — live per-block variance is huge; single blocks are uninformative.** `solveRatio` ranged **0.023× → 3.67×**; `realizedPower` **0.54 → 434**. Live PoW solvetime is ≈ exponential. The earlier "block 118 = structural ~9σ stall" was a **bootstrap artifact** — blocks 2–117 in `state.json` were bulk-mined/semi-synthetic (sd 0.16), not representative of live mining. ⇒ **F3 (startup throughput stall) is DROPPED** — no evidence of a stall; realized throughput sits at/above configured.

**Finding 2 (robust signal) — the feed-forward anchor under-calls equilibrium by ~1.4×.** Don't read single blocks; read where difficulty *converged*. At power 2, difficulty held ~1000–1160 ≈ anchor 1170 (calibration correct; outlier-removed aggregate realized ≈ 2.17 ≈ 2). At power 10, difficulty **climbed via LWMA feedback to ~8400**, and only there did a block hit target (**block 128: dif 8396, ratio 0.94**). So true equilibrium ≈ **8400** vs anchor **5851** → **anchor ≈ 30–45% low** (8400/5851 = 1.44; aggregate realized over the power-10 window ≈ 14 vs configured 10 — same factor). The offset appeared **right after extra hardware was assigned to the casino pool**.

**Finding 3 — the real symptom is the OPPOSITE of the original complaint.** While feedback climbed 5851 → 8400, blocks ran **too fast** (window mean `solveRatio` ≈ **0.73**), not delayed. The "first nodes take too long" impression was a couple of high-variance slow blocks (115: 3.67×, 129: 2.95×). So the issue is mild over-issuance during catch-up, not a delaying shock.

**Plan revision (priorities updated):**

| Item | Was | Now (post steady-state verdict) |
|---|---|---|
| Power accounting (casino-pool credits) | 🔴 PRIMARY (suspected bug) | ✅ **audited — correct, no bug** |
| Anchor calibration | 🔴 PRIMARY | ✅ **verified correct at steady state (power 2)** — no fix |
| F1 — EMA on power | highest | 🟢 optional polish — softens the step/overshoot |
| F2 — asymmetric easing | medium | 🟢 optional polish (quality) |
| F3 — startup stall | medium | ⚪ **dropped** (no evidence) |
| F4 — lower α | fallback | fallback (unneeded; not the cause) |
| Confirm calibration at power ≈10 | — | 🔵 open (low priority; likely fine) |

**Lead hypothesis (casino-pool undercount): ❌ REFUTED by code audit (2026-06-25).** Traced the full path: `RouteNonceAttempt` (and DiceGame's manual mirror) makes **exactly one** attempt per bet, round-robin to the casino chain *or* the node's own chain (`NextNonceTarget`) — no doubling. `GetTotalActiveMiningPower = Σ HardwareRate` over {player + running bots} = Σ `TotalCredits` (individual **+** casino); every casino-routed attempt originates from one of those counted credits. The `casino` node is **not** a runner (`BuildBotConfigs` excludes `player` and requires a valid strategy; casino is a wallet/pool node) → no uncounted attempts, no double-count. One logical chain (consensus via `BroadcastBlock`; globally sequential indices confirm it) → total attempt rate = power, so `anchor = InitialDifficulty × power` **is** the correct equilibrium level. **Accounting is correct.**

**Revised likely cause: feed-forward + feedback overshoot during the un-converged transient (not a calibration bug).** At the step the anchor sets the level (~5851), but easing keeps difficulty *below* equilibrium for a few blocks → those blocks run fast → `LWMA(solvetimes)` small → `feedbackTrim = Target/LWMA > 1` → `target = anchor × trim` overshoots above the anchor → difficulty climbs past it (to 8418, still rising at block 129 — peak not yet reached). Test Run #1 captured only the climb, not the settle-back. The feed-forward already corrects the level; the feedback then piles on, reacting to the easing-induced fast blocks.

**Decider — the ≥30-block steady-state run (in progress, using the new 100X→1000X dev tool):**
- difficulty settles **≈ anchor** (5851 at power 10), mean ratio → 1.0 ⇒ **no calibration error**; the 1.4× was pure transient overshoot → refinement = *tame overshoot on large steps* (F1 EMA on power smooths the step; or damp feedback while the anchor makes a big jump).
- difficulty stabilizes **~40% above anchor**, ratio → 1.0 ⇒ a **real factor** exists → investigate consensus/orphan losses or a constant.

Caveat: aggregate realized power is time-weighted, so a few long-tail solvetimes can bias a small sample — judge on ≥30 blocks.

### F5 Steady-State Run — VERDICT (2026-06-25) ✅ regulator is correctly calibrated

Second trace: **constant power = 2.0** for 32 blocks (no step), run fast via the dev time-accel tool. Aggregates (dropping the 2 leading warmup blocks):

| Metric | Observed | Expected if calibrated |
|---|---|---|
| aggregate realized power (`100·Σdif/Σsolve`) | **2.05** | ≈ 2.0 ✓ |
| mean `solveRatio` | **0.94** | ≈ 1.0 ✓ |
| mean difficulty | **1121** | ≈ anchor 1170 ✓ |

Difficulty orbited the anchor (oscillating 836–1436 under the heavy per-block variance, but **centered on 1170**), not ~40% above it. **No calibration error.** This **confirms the transient-overshoot explanation**: Test Run #1's ~1.4× was the un-converged feed-forward+feedback overshoot after the 2→10 step (only the climb was captured), **not** a bad anchor. Per-block variance reconfirmed (ratios 0.097→3.36 at constant power) — always judge by aggregates.

**Conclusion:** the hybrid regulator is **fundamentally sound** — no anchor factor, no accounting fix. Remaining work is optional polish for the *transient* on large power steps: **F1 (EMA on power)** to soften the step (and thus the overshoot), **F2 (asymmetric easing)** for quality. F3/F4 stay dropped/fallback.

> **Caveat — confirmed at power 2, not yet at power 10.** The `anchor = InitialDifficulty × power` relation is linear and the accounting audit holds regardless of pool split, so a power-10 calibration error is unlikely — but a single steady-state run at power ≈10 (let it settle ≥20 blocks past the step) would fully close it. Until then, treat F1/F2 as optional polish rather than fixes.

### Dev tooling — time acceleration 100X→1000X (2026-06-25) ✅

To run validation samples (e.g. the ≥30-block steady-state runs F5 needs) in ~1/10 the wall-clock time **without altering the dynamics under measurement**.

- **Key correctness point**: bumping `SpeedMultiplier` alone is wrong — it speeds the clock but not bet execution, so in-game solvetime per block inflates ~10×, the regulator reads "blocks too slow", and `feedbackTrim` (clamped [0.5, 2]) can't compensate → difficulty collapses. The dynamics we measure would be destroyed.
- **Correct design**: an orthogonal `CalendarTimeService.DevTimeScale` (int 1..10) scales **both** by the same factor `k`: the calendar clock (`delta × SpeedMultiplier × k`) **and** bet execution (`SimulationService._Process`: `simDelta = delta × k` for player + bots). The power fed to the regulator (`HardwareRate`/`GetTotalActiveMiningPower`) is **deliberately not scaled**. ⇒ `attempts/in-game-second = (rate·k)/(100·k) = rate/100` is invariant → difficulty, power, in-game solvetimes and ratios are identical; only wall-clock compresses (`real_time/block = TargetBlockSeconds/(100·k)`).
- **UI**: `UI/DevTimeScaleSelector/DevTimeScaleSelector.cs` (programmatic, like StatusBar) — selector "100X".."1000X" in DiceGame (next to the APS selector) and BlockExplorer (under the StatusBar). Live (next frame). **Not persisted** — resets to 100X on restart.
- **Caveat**: `MaxBetsPerFrame = 10`/node/frame would throttle only at extreme scale × very high single-node hardware (~99 credits at 1000X); irrelevant for the measurement regime (power ~10–15 split across nodes).
- **Files**: `CalendarTimeService.cs`, `SimulationService.cs`, `UI/DevTimeScaleSelector/DevTimeScaleSelector.cs`, `DiceGame.cs`, `BlockExplorer.cs`.

**Companion: "Discard Hardware (−1)" button** (Pools & Hardware screen, 2026-06-25 ✅) — the counterpart to the DEV "Buy Hardware". `HardwareAllocationRepository.RemoveCredits` drops a credit (casino pool first, then individual; floored at **1 total** so reported power stays consistent with `TotalCredits`). Enables dropping a node to a single private-pool credit and **power-decrease test runs** (needed to validate F2 asymmetric easing — the fast-relief-on-drop path — and the open power-≈10 calibration check). Built programmatically next to Buy Hardware (no .tscn edit), disabled at the 1-credit floor. Files: `HardwareAllocationRepository.cs`, `BTCPoolsAndHardwareShop.cs`.

### Phase F1 — EMA on the power signal *(secondary; smooths the anchor on a step)*

- **What**: smooth power before it feeds the anchor, so it tracks *realized* throughput, not the instantaneous configured step; also damps the noisy 18.9/12.3 swings.
- **Where**: `NetworkRoot.SetActiveMiningPower()` (single chokepoint):
  `_activeMiningPower = _activeMiningPower <= 0 ? raw : _activeMiningPower + PowerEmaAlpha·(raw − _activeMiningPower);`
  with `PowerEmaAlpha ≈ 0.2–0.35`; bypass-to-`raw` on the first non-zero sample so it doesn't crawl up from 0.
- **Acceptance**: in the 1→11 step the anchor rises over 3–5 samples without leading throughput; the 2.43× block disappears.
- **Risk**: low. Trade-off: slightly slower reaction to *legitimate* power changes (mitigated by F2's asymmetry).

### Phase F2 — Asymmetric easing

- **What**: split `DifficultyEaseAlpha` into `EaseAlphaUp` (gentle, ≈0.4–0.5: a new miner must not punish newcomers) and `EaseAlphaDown` (fast, ≈0.8: relieve a stuck-too-hard chain quickly).
- **Where**: `BlockchainService.GetNextBlockDifficulty()` — `double alpha = target >= current ? EaseAlphaUp : EaseAlphaDown;`
- **Acceptance**: increases ramp over ~3–4 blocks; decreases resolve in ~1–2 (validate by simulating a miner leaving).
- **Risk**: low. Directly matches the design goal "don't delay the first nodes' mining."

### Phase F3 — Tame the startup throughput transient ⚪ DROPPED

> **Dropped after Test Run #1** — the "startup stall" was a bootstrap-data artifact; live realized throughput sits at/above configured (no stall). Kept for the record; revisit only if a real stall is ever measured. Sub-options below were never implemented.

Sub-options, least→most invasive; pick based on what F0 shows:

- **F3a — Desynchronize cadence**: seed each runner's `AccumulatorSeconds` with a small jitter (`Random·interval`) in `BuildBotRunner` so they don't all tick on the same frames.
- **F3b — Protect the backlog from a hitch**: raise `MaxBacklogSeconds` (e.g. 2→5) and/or clamp per-frame `delta`, so a single hitch doesn't discard attempts (fixes the permanent loss behind the ~3.3).
- **F3c — Soften bot cold-start**: avoid several bots cycling stop/recharge in the first interval (e.g. brief grace before applying stops right after start).
- **Acceptance**: realized power reaches configured within ≤1 block, no stall/overshoot (measured via F0).
- **Risk**: medium (touches the shared player+bot executor). Apply changes one at a time, each measured.

### Phase F4 — Palliative knob *(fallback / one-liner)*

- **What**: lower the default `DifficultyEaseAlpha` 0.7 → 0.5–0.6.
- **When**: only if F1–F3 are deferred and immediate relief is wanted. **Softens the easing ramp, not the throughput transient** (the real cause of block 118). Subsumed by `EaseAlphaUp` once F2 lands.
- **Risk**: minimal. Trade-off: slower convergence + a longer window of too-fast (under-difficulty) blocks during the transition.

### Phase F5 — Validation

- **What**: re-run a power step with the F0 trace; judge by **aggregates**, not single blocks (live per-block variance is ≈ exponential — see Test Run #1).
- **Acceptance**:
  - steady state (**≥30 blocks** at constant power): aggregate realized power (`100·Σdif / ΣsolveSec`) ≈ configured power within ~10%, and difficulty converges near the anchor (not ~40% above it as in Test Run #1);
  - window mean `solveRatio` ≈ 1.0 (vs ≈ 0.73 during the un-calibrated catch-up);
  - power drop: difficulty cedes in ≤2 blocks (verifies F2).
- Use ≥30 blocks because the aggregate is time-weighted and a few long-tail solvetimes can bias a small sample.

### Recommendation (revised after Test Run #1 + power-accounting audit)

Power accounting was **audited and is correct** — the casino-undercount idea is dead. The ~1.4× elevation in Test Run #1 is most likely **feed-forward + feedback overshoot during the still-converging transient**, not a calibration error. **Next gate: the ≥30-block steady-state run** (using the new dev time-acceleration tool):
- if difficulty settles ≈ anchor with ratio → 1.0 ⇒ no calibration fix needed; pursue **overshoot taming** — **F1 (EMA on power)** to soften the step, optionally damp the feedback while the anchor makes a large jump;
- if it stabilizes ~40% above anchor ⇒ a real factor exists; investigate consensus/orphan losses or a constant before any anchor change.

**F2 (asymmetric easing)** remains a quality improvement; **F3 dropped**; **F4** fallback only. Validate every change against a ≥30-block steady-state aggregate (F5). Do **not** apply an empirical anchor factor until the steady-state run distinguishes overshoot from a real offset.
